# 🎹 Krypton

Krypton is an audio player library primarily meant for Discord Bots. It is heavily based off the amazing [**Lavaplayer**](https://github.com/sedmelluq/lavaplayer)

- [**Support Server #krypton**](https://discord.gg/Vkbmb8kuH4)

## ❓ Why?

While developing my bot, [**Mixtape**](https://mixtape.systems), I ran into a lot of issues where lavaplayer just wasn't flexible enough for me. I went on to convert almost everything to Kotlin ([my fork](https://github.com/mixtape-oss/lavaplayer)), but it still had some limitations and I wasn't very confident that I could successfully rewrite parts of lavaplayer without breaking it.

So, I decided to plan out a more efficient and performant API powered by [**Kotlin Coroutines**](https://github.com/kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines).

## 📦 What will it support?

I plan on having complete feature parity with lavaplayer but also having some cool new stuff. 
Some of this will consist of:

- Audio Filters
- Custom Source Managers
- Wide range of supported formats (WAV, Mp3, Flac, Matroska / WebM, MP4 / M4A, etc...)
- Precise track seeking

## 🚀 Any examples?

I don't have any examples/ideas of how to use Krypton just yet! Make sure to stay tuned in our **Support Server**
